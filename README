It current has a working game of poker, which can have human or AI players.

The main function is currently set up to train a neural network using a genetic algorithm.
It generates a number of tables, each with 8 random players on it. These players play a set number of hands, or until there is only 1 player left. 

Fitness is evaluated based on both highest chip count, and winrate %. the best player of either attribute is then carried on to the next generation.

Children are generated with slight variations to weights and biases and the process is repeated a specified number of times.
