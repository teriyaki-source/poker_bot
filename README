This is still a work in progress to be sure

It current has a working game of poker, which can have human or AI players (although it is only currently set up to train a bot).

The main function is currently set up to train a neural network using a genetic algorithm, tracking Big Blind return / 100 hands as the fitness metric.

Variables / params can be adjusted in the config.py file

Children are generated with slight variations to weights and biases and the process is repeated a specified number of times. During training, randomised bots are also introduced to try and reduce the impact / chance of overfitting. 

Currently the play is still a bit aggressive with bots reporting > 10BB return / 100 hands which is a bit high. Still some balancing to do.

After training, the weights and biases are saved into a .txt file with relevant name to potentially be used later. Loading players has not been implemented. Header information for each file is also still a TODO, so files can be sorted better after doing lots of training.

Goals / TODOs: 
- This README
- side pots :(
- save header information properly and file sorting
- get a stable bot with realistic fitness
- adjust main.py to have a bunch of humans playing against the AI, using custom input cards - so it can be used to play an actual game


TODO: Finish this
